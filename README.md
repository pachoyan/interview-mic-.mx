# Technical Interview MIC MX

Welcome to the technical interview for the role of Software Developer. In this session, we'll be assessing your proficiency in object-oriented programming principles, design patterns, and your familiarity with either Java or C#. The primary task for today's session is to build a calculator application from scratch, starting with the basic arithmetic operation of addition and gradually incorporating other operations such as subtraction, division, and multiplication.

**Duration:** 

60 minutes.

**Language Options:** 

You can choose to implement the calculator in either Java or C#, whichever you're most comfortable with.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Incremental Development:**

We'll follow an incremental approach, beginning with the simplest operation (addition) and then progressively adding more functionalities.
   
2. **Unit Testing:** 
 
After implementing each operation, you'll be required to write unit tests to ensure the functionality works as expected. You can choose between JUnit 5 for Java or the testing framework you're most comfortable with for C#.

4. **Pair Programming:** 

This interview will be conducted in a pair programming format, where I'll guide you through the process, provide assistance, and evaluate your problem-solving approach.

5. **Resources:** 

You're allowed to use external resources such as Google and Stack Overflow to search for solutions or clarification on any programming concepts or syntax.

6. **Git Integration:**

We'll use Git for version control. Commit frequently, and create branches for each operation. Your ability to use commits and branches effectively will be evaluated.

7. **Completion Not Required:** 

Please note that it's not mandatory to complete the entire task within the given time frame. We're more interested in assessing your understanding of fundamental programming concepts and your problem-solving skills.

**Purpose of the Interview:**

This interview aims to evaluate your knowledge and proficiency in the following areas:

- Object-oriented programming principles (e.g., encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance).
- Design patterns relevant to the task at hand.
- Implementation of unit tests and test-driven development practices.
- Your understanding of language-specific features such as interfaces, data types, and syntax.

Feel free to ask any questions or seek clarification at any point during the session. Let's begin by discussing your preferred programming language and any initial thoughts or strategies you have for tackling the task
